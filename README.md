# DISCLAIMER:

I have absolutely no idea if this is a safe and secure way to do authentication. This is an older version of the backend of [Monkey Mall](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/chimpstitute/6878051502218331/).

# Credits:

I used large code snippets of SolarisDev09's [AdvancedPlayFab](https://github.com/SolarisDev09/AdvancedPlayfab?tab=readme-ov-file) and JokerJosh0's [EasyPlayFab](https://github.com/JokerJosh0/EasyPlayfab).
